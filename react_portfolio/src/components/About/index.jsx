        <p>I am a third year student at MSU Denver studying computer science.</p>
        <p>I have worked on a few front end and back end projects which will be displayed on the portfolio page. I am familiar with a bit of everything when it comes to web development.</p>
        <p>
          I was born in Denver, Colorado and have been here my whole life thus far. I graduated from Valor Christian High School and went straight into college from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests are nature, music, art, and online games. My ambition is to become a software engineer or web developer for a company either based here or overseas in Japan.
